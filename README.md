# AR Boutique Online Store

Welcome to the AR Boutique Online Store! üõçÔ∏è This repository contains the source code for our innovative online store that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) technology to enhance the shopping experience. Our platform is built using a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability, resilience, and flexibility.

## Microservices Architecture

Our system is meticulously designed using a microservices architecture, which offers several key benefits:

### Scalability
- Each microservice operates independently, allowing us to scale specific components of our system based on demand. Whether it's managing user authentication, product catalog, or order processing, our architecture ensures optimal resource utilization.

### Resilience
- Failure in one microservice does not necessarily disrupt the entire system. With proper fault isolation and fallback mechanisms, our architecture enhances fault tolerance and system resilience. This ensures that our users can continue to shop seamlessly, even in the face of component failures.

### Flexibility
- Microservices empower our development teams to work autonomously on individual services, enabling rapid iteration and deployment. This decoupling of services facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing us to deliver new features and updates to our platform with agility.

### Polyglot Persistence
- With microservices, we can choose the most suitable database technology for each service's requirements. Whether it's a document-oriented database like MongoDB for product catalog management or a relational database like PostgreSQL for transactional data, our architecture accommodates diverse data storage needs.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Our microservices are organized around specific business domains, aligning closely with our organizational structure and business goals. This domain-centric approach to architecture fosters better alignment between technology and business objectives, promoting clarity and maintainability.

### API Gateway
- To streamline communication between microservices and clients, we utilize an API gateway. This gateway serves as a single entry point for clients and provides functionalities such as authentication, rate limiting, and request routing. This abstraction layer simplifies client interactions and enhances security.

## Key Microservices

Our system comprises several key microservices, each responsible for distinct business capabilities:

1. **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0.
2. **Product Catalog Service**: Manages the catalog of products available in the store, including details such as pricing, availability, and descriptions.
3. **Order Management Service**: Handles order processing, including creation, modification, and fulfillment.
4. **Payment Gateway Service**: Integrates with payment providers to facilitate secure and seamless transactions.
5. **AR Visualization Service**: Generates AR visualizations of products using computer vision and AR technology.

## Technologies Used

Our project utilizes cutting-edge technologies to deliver an immersive shopping experience:

- **Programming Languages**: Java, JavaScript
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Spring Boot, React.js, TensorFlow
- **Cloud Services**: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Database**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
